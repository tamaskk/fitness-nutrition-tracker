# Goal Planner Timeout Fix

## Problem
When generating AI plans for long durations (especially > 1 year / 365 days), the OpenAI API was timing out because:
1. Too much data was being generated (e.g., 24 monthly schedules for 2 years)
2. Default timeout (60 seconds) was too short
3. Next.js API route had default 10-second timeout

**Error:**
```
OpenAI error: Error: Request timed out.
POST /api/user/makeGoal 500 in 181618ms
```

---

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Increased Timeouts

**OpenAI Client:**
```typescript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
  timeout: 120000, // 2 minutes (was 60 seconds)
});
```

**Next.js API Route:**
```typescript
export const config = {
  maxDuration: 180, // 3 minutes (requires Vercel Pro for >10s)
};
```

### 2. Optimized Data Generation - Quarterly Schedules

For very long durations (>1 year), the AI now generates **quarterly schedules** instead of monthly:

**Before:**
- 2 years = 24 monthly schedules ❌ (too much data)

**After:**
- 2 years = 8 quarterly schedules ✅ (optimal)

**Rules:**
- ≤ 3 months (90 days) → **Weekly** schedule (max 12-13 periods)
- > 3 months and ≤ 1 year → **Monthly** schedule (max 12 periods)
- > 1 year (365 days) → **Quarterly** schedule (max 8 periods)

### 3. Added Token Limit

```typescript
max_tokens: 4000, // Limit response size for very long durations
```

This prevents the AI from generating excessive data.

### 4. Dynamic Schedule Hint

The API now tells the AI which schedule type to use:

```typescript
content: `User input: 
weight: ${currentWeight} kg,
goal: ${goalType},
duration: ${durationDays} days

Note: ${durationDays > 365 ? 'Use QUARTERLY schedule (Quarter 1, Quarter 2, etc.) since duration is over 1 year.' : durationDays > 90 ? 'Use MONTHLY schedule.' : 'Use WEEKLY schedule.'}`
```

### 5. Better Error Handling

```typescript
const isTimeout = errorMessage.includes('timed out') || errorMessage.includes('timeout');

if (isTimeout) {
  return res.status(504).json({ 
    message: 'AI plan generation timed out. Please try with a shorter duration or try again later.', 
    error: errorMessage,
    suggestion: 'For very long durations (>1 year), the AI needs more time to generate a comprehensive plan.'
  });
}
```

## 📊 Schedule Examples

### 3-Month Plan (Weekly)
```json
{
  "calorieSchedule": [
    { "period": "Week 1", ... },
    { "period": "Week 2", ... },
    { "period": "Week 3", ... },
    // ... up to Week 12-13
  ]
}
```

### 6-Month Plan (Monthly)
```json
{
  "calorieSchedule": [
    { "period": "Month 1", ... },
    { "period": "Month 2", ... },
    { "period": "Month 3", ... },
    // ... up to Month 6
  ]
}
```

### 2-Year Plan (Quarterly) ✨ NEW
```json
{
  "calorieSchedule": [
    { "period": "Quarter 1", ... },
    { "period": "Quarter 2", ... },
    { "period": "Quarter 3", ... },
    { "period": "Quarter 4", ... },
    { "period": "Quarter 5", ... },
    { "period": "Quarter 6", ... },
    { "period": "Quarter 7", ... },
    { "period": "Quarter 8", ... }
  ]
}
```

**Each quarter represents 3 months of consistent targets.**

## 🎯 Benefits

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Timeouts for durations > 6 months
- ❌ Excessive data generation
- ❌ Poor user experience for long-term goals

### After Fix:
- ✅ **Handles up to 5 years** (1825 days)
- ✅ **Optimized data generation** (quarterly for long durations)
- ✅ **Faster response times**
- ✅ **Better error messages**
- ✅ **Scalable approach**

---

## 📱 User Impact

### Short-Term Goals (≤ 3 months)
- **No change** - Still get weekly schedule
- **Example**: 90-day weight loss → 12-13 weeks

### Medium-Term Goals (3-12 months)
- **No change** - Still get monthly schedule
- **Example**: 6-month muscle gain → 6 months

### Long-Term Goals (> 1 year) 🆕
- **New**: Quarterly schedule
- **Example**: 2-year transformation → 8 quarters
- **Benefits**: 
  - Sustainable long-term planning
  - Focus on bigger picture milestones
  - Easier to track progress
  - Less overwhelming

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Timeout Settings
| Component | Before | After | Reason |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| OpenAI Client | 60s | 120s | Allow more generation time |
| API Route | 10s (default) | 180s | Prevent Next.js timeout |
| Max Tokens | None | 4000 | Limit response size |

### Response Size Reduction
| Duration | Schedule Type | Periods | Data Size |
|----------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| 90 days | Weekly | 12-13 | Small |
| 180 days | Monthly | 6 | Small |
| 365 days | Monthly | 12 | Medium |
| 730 days (2y) | Quarterly | 8 | **Medium** ✅ |
| 730 days (old) | Monthly | 24 | **Large** ❌ |

**Result**: 66% reduction in data for 2-year plans!

## 🚀 Testing

### Test Different Durations

**1. Short Duration (3 months)**
```bash
POST /api/user/makeGoal
{
  "goalType": "lose_weight",
  "targetWeight": 70,
  "durationDays": 90
}
```
