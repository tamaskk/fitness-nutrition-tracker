## 🔧 Next Steps: Environment Variables Setup

Your app is deployed but needs environment variables to function properly. Here's what you need to do:

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to your Vercel dashboard and add these environment variables:

#### Required Variables:
```bash
# MongoDB Connection (CRITICAL)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@your-cluster.mongodb.net/fitness-tracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# NextAuth Configuration (CRITICAL)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://fitness-nutrition-tracker-2cs3szgtn.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here
```

#### Optional Variables (for enhanced features):
```bash
# Nutritionix API (for better food data)
NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID=your-nutritionix-app-id
NUTRITIONIX_API_KEY=your-nutritionix-api-key

# OpenAI API (for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### 2. Generate NextAuth Secret

Run this command to generate a secure secret:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 3. Set Up MongoDB Atlas

1. Go to https://mongodb.com/atlas
2. Create a free cluster
3. Create a database user
4. Get your connection string
5. Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster>` in the MONGODB_URI

### 4. Add Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com/tamas-krisztian-kalmans-projects/fitness-nutrition-tracker
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Environment Variables"
4. Add each variable with its value
5. Make sure to select "Production", "Preview", and "Development" for each variable

### 5. Redeploy After Adding Variables

After adding environment variables, redeploy:
```bash
vercel --prod
```
