   git clone <repository-url>
   cd goal
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # MongoDB
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@your-cluster.mongodb.net/fitness-tracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority

   # NextAuth
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-here

   # External APIs (Optional - app works with free APIs and fallbacks)
   # Nutritionix API for food data (optional)
   NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID=your-nutritionix-app-id
   NUTRITIONIX_API_KEY=your-nutritionix-api-key
   
   # OpenAI API for AI features (optional)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   
   # Note: Recipe search uses TheMealDB API (completely free, no key needed)
   ```

4. **Generate NextAuth secret**
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

5. **Set up MongoDB**
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account at https://mongodb.com/atlas
   - Create a new cluster and database
   - Get your connection string and add it to `.env.local`

6. **Initialize the database (optional)**
   ```bash
   # After setting up MongoDB, initialize with demo data
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/init
   ```

7. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

8. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) (or the port shown in terminal)
